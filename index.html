    <h1>Project Team Undergrad 7: Healthcare expenditure, Insurance coverage, and Maternal mortality by states COSI 116A F23</h1>

    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p><em>Through our project, we hope to deliver the status of the following 3 features: maternal mortality, healthcare spending, and insurance coverage by states.
           By producing linked/interactive visualizations, we hope to suggest possible correlations between the three features to the general public.
    </em></p>
    
    <p><em>Expectation: There is a clear focus, and a developed explanation of the problem, and a reasonable response is proposed.</em></p>

    
    <h1>Visualization</h1>
    
    <p><em>Include the interactive visualization as part of this page. Static example follows.</em></p>
    
  </div>
  
  <!-- Your visualization here -->
  <div class="vis-holder">
    <!-- Change viewbox to whatever you want, e.g. "0 0 1000 6000" This determines your aspect ratio and coordinate system -->    
    <!-- Delete all the sample SVG code below after the viewbox to before the closing tag. Populate this part of the SVG with D3. -->
    <h3> Maternal Mortality by States</h3>
    <p>Brush over individual scatterplot points in order to see which states you're looking at.</p>
    <div class="scatterplot-holder" id="scatterplot"></div>
    <p>Although black women are 3x more likely to die of complications related to childbirth than white women in the US, this chart reveals that the
      actual percentage of non-white residents in any one state does not correlate with the amount of maternal deaths per capita in that state—a
      surprising find that indicates that the racial composition of a state's population alone doesn't seem to be the primary factor influencing
      maternal mortality rates. Other factors, such as healthcare access, quality of care, socioeconomic conditions, and systemic issues, might play a
      more substantial role in contributing to the disparities in maternal mortality rate </p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    
    <p><em>Final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.</em></p>
    <div class="visual - explanation">
      <H3>Project Overview</H3>
        <p>
          Our project is about visualizing the status of the 3 features: maternal mortality, healthcare spending, and insurance coverage, all of which would be linked and interacted using a common field ‘state’ (by state, we mean individual states of the U.S). </br>
          By generating appropriate visualizations that deliver the status of the three features using primarily d3.js, we hope to be able to deliver the general status and possible correlations between the three features to the general public. </br>
          To achieve our desired delivery, we would take advantage of linking/brushing (between the visualizations to enhance the interactiveness of individual data point across our datasets), infographic types (bar charts, US map, scatter plot, and table), as well as color coding and other aspects learned throughout COSI 116 to optimize the visual delivery. 
        </p>
      <h3>Target Audience</h3>
        <p>
          As we intend to deliver a landscape of health-related features and how they might possibly be interrelated, the target audience that would be best addressed is the general public (specifically, web surfers). </br>
          It is easy to come across many infographics intended to raise awareness or pique interest in particular topics/subjects targeted for the general public browsing the web. Given the web is open for anyone and is used by people with a wide range of backgrounds and understanding on the topic that the infographics are focused on, we do not intend to encode any in-depth/professional data from biomedical or actuarial domains and the likes. </br>
          Conversely, to catch the web surfers’ attention sweeply and effectively, each visualization needs to encode data in a way that intuitively delivers the status of the features and their possible interrelatedness. This would require trimmed and cleaned up data to present a holistic picture, consistent color scheme for linking, brushing, and highlighting to prevent/minimize distractions, and yet not a cookie-cutter, cliche visualizations to stop web surfers from scrolling down/clicking away.
        </p>
      <h3>Visualizations:</h3>
        <p>
          There are 4 primary visualizations that we plan to create and x subsidiary visualizations.</br>
          The 4 primary visualizations are: US map (for healthcare expenditure), bar chart (for insurance coverage), scatter plot (for maternal mortality), and table (showing numerical data points of all 3 features).

          the data is classified by each state, region(NE, NW, ME, MW, SE, SW), and categories (clinical, items, surgical, etc.) of healthcare related spendings.
        </p>
        <em>Progress made for Sprint2: </br>
