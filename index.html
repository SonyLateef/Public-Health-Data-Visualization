    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    
    <div class="visual-explanation">
      <H3>Project Overview</H3>
        <p>
          Our project is about visualizing the status of the 3 features: maternal mortality, healthcare spending, and insurance coverage, all of which would be linked and interacted with using a common field, ‘state’ (by state, we mean individual states of the U.S). </br><br>
          By generating appropriate visualizations that deliver the status of the three features using primarily d3.js, we hope to be able to deliver the general status and possible correlations between the three features to the general public. </br></br>
          To achieve our desired delivery, we would take advantage of linking/brushing (between the visualizations to enhance the interactiveness of individual data point across our datasets), infographic types (bar charts, US map, scatter plot, and table), as well as color coding and other aspects learned throughout COSI 116 to optimize the visual delivery. 
        </p>
      <h3>Target Audience</h3>
        <p>
          As we intend to deliver a landscape of health-related features and how they might possibly be interrelated, the target audience that would be best addressed is the general public (specifically, web surfers). </br></br>
          It is easy to come across many infographics intended to raise awareness or pique interest in particular topics/subjects targeted for the general public browsing the web. Given the web is open for anyone and is used by people with a wide range of backgrounds and understanding on the topic that the infographics are focused on, we do not intend to encode any in-depth/professional data from biomedical or actuarial domains and the likes. </br></br>
          Conversely, to catch the web surfers’ attention effectively, each visualization needs to encode data in a way that intuitively delivers the status of the features and their possible interrelatedness. This would require trimmed and cleaned up data to present a holistic picture, consistent color scheme for linking, brushing, and highlighting to prevent/minimize distractions, and yet not a cookie-cutter, cliche visualizations to stop web surfers from scrolling down/clicking away.
        </p>
      <h3>Visualizations:</h3>
        <p>
          There are 3 primary visualizations that we plan to create and 1 subsidiary visualizations.</br>
          <ol>
            <li>Scatter Plot:
              <p>
                The goal for this scatterplot is to display the rate of maternal mortality deaths in each state in America, contrasted with the percentage
                of non-white residents in that state, in order to investigate whether there is a correlation between the two. It also links to the rest
                of the visualizations in order to see whether there is a correlation between either of these factors and spending on healthcare expenditure
                or insurance coverage.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Bar Chart: 
              <p>
                The goal for this barchart is to display the percentage of insured people throughout the states, and link to the rest visualizations (scatterplot and map) to 
                find if the barchart data is correlated with the data in the scatterplot or the map. Since it shows the percentage of the insured people,
                the correlation could be traced easily by the numbers of healthcare expenditure in the map, or the position of a point by a state in the scatterplot.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>US Map:
              <p>
                The goal for this map is to display the healthcare expenditure in America by state, and link to the rest of the visualizations (scatterplot
                and barchart) to be able to view one state based on a search feature and compare it with the other 2 visualizations.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Table:
              <p>
                The goal for this table is to display the corresponding data from the scatterplot, barchart, and map. Rather than displaying a large table with
                all the state data, this table allows the user to choose a state from the drop-down menu and view it's data. The user can select to continue
                viewing states, or reset the table if necessary to allow for cleaner data visualized.

              </p>

          </ol>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <h3>Primary Datasets for visualizations:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Maternal Mortalities across States</strong></li>
        <p span="analysis - mortality">
         <p>Although black women are 3x more likely to die of complications related to childbirth than white women in the US, this chart reveals that the
          actual percentage of non-white residents in any one state does not correlate with the amount of maternal deaths per capita in that state—a
          surprising find that indicates that the racial composition of a state's population alone doesn't seem to be the primary factor influencing
          maternal mortality rates. <br><br>Other factors, such as healthcare access, quality of care, socioeconomic conditions, and systemic issues,
          might play a more substantial role in contributing to the disparities in maternal mortality rate. </p>
        </p>
      <li><strong>Insurance Coverage by States</strong></li>
        <p span="analysis - insurance">
          Insurance Coverage explores the percentage of insured people by states.
          Downloaded from <a href="https://www.census.gov/">census.gov</a>,
          the data is classified by each state by any type of insurance that people throughout the states might be covered with.
        </p>
      <li><strong>Healthcare Expenditure by States</strong></li>
        <p span="analysis - expenditure">
          Healthcare Expenditure explores both the aggregate and per capita healthcare related expenditures by states.
          Downloaded from <a href="https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/national-health-expenditure-data/state-residence">cms.gov</a>,
          the data is classified by each state, region(NE, NW, ME, MW, SE, SW), and categories (clinical, items, surgical, etc.) of healthcare related spendings.
        </p>

    </ol>

    
    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p><em>Summary of task table.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Clearly describes domain tasks, processes, goals and abstract tasks for domain problems.</em></p>
    <p><em>Why healthcare?</em></p>
    <p><em>Among a diversity of domains, healthcare stands as one of the most relevant domain in its interactions with the general public and in its applicability as a benchmark or a control variable to other domains.</br></br>
            Because healthcare is one of the most widely and deeply explored domains with a numerouso touchpoints with different groups of people and areas of studies,</br></br>
            however, data sets as well as the goal of the project had to be carefully investigated. </br>
            Given a plethora of visualization projects in the field, we tried to come up with relevant yet original features within healthcare such that interesting correlations could be found by comparing and overlaying the features. </br></br>
    </em></p>

    <p><em>Choosing Features</em></p>
    <p><em>Although cliche, we started with healthcare spending of the US and each state as a benchmark 
            believing that the aggregate spending delivers an overall landscape of the healthcare expenditure accurately.</br></br>

            We then proceed to include relatively unexplored features such as</br>
            1) a relationship between the average temperature of a household and its healthcare expenditure, </br>
            2) a correlation between food & grocery expenditure and healthcare expense, </br>
            3) an effect of political leaning on healthcare spending.</br>

            While we enjoyed reading through and exploring available data from those hypothesis,
            and quite a lot of data sets were available,
            we were faced with datasets with overlapping time period (specific year or month), 
            the same time unit (yearly vs monthly vs weekly),
            the same unit of data (household-level, state-level, and federal-level), and etc.</br>

            Given that the dataset had to be adjustable into either .csv or .json after meeting the above criteria,
            we chose the following 3 features: maternal mortality with non-white racial composition, health insurance coverage ratio, and health care expenditure.
            Although the finazlied features may not sound as intriguing as the features from the previous ideation, 
            we modified the data sets for the chosen feature into .csv and .json to make them compatible with d3.js.</br>

           
    </em></p>
    <h1>Design Process</h1>

    <p>Scatterplot: At first, the scatterplot just consisted of a bunch of dots with no names of states. However, due to the "details on demand" rule, when a 
      user brushes over the dots, they become red and their name appears. The goal with this was to make it easy to distinguish the states—if all of
      the names are there originally, it would be very difficult to read all of the names; this was discovered during usability testing. The other
      change was to use color in order to show which states were brushed. The chart remained simple so that users can easily tell what's going on
      (as we discussed in class, it's easy to confuse a  user if there are unnecessary additional marks), and the colors are there to help the user
      distinguish whether states have been brushed.</p>

    <p>Map: </p>
    
    <p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
    Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
    Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>


    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p>
      For this project, we created three visualizations—scatterplot, bar chart, and map—that are interactive and linked to each other. Although there 
      is room to make things more visually appealing, we believe that the visualizations are effective in conveying the data and allowing users to see
      whether or not various statistics correlate with each other on the state level (for example, whether or not maternal mortality rates correlate with
      the percentage of non-white residents in a state, healthcare expenditure for that state, and insurance coverage for the state). Furthermore, these
      visualizations successfully work together in order to convey more complex information about how the different data interacts. In the future,
      there could be opportunities to represent more data to the visualizations by using marks such as color, opacity, and size to represent more data 
      within the same visualization.
